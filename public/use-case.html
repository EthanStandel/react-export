    <p>
      This file exists as a better test of being able to drop the script in
      arbitrarily. Vite's normal index.html is built at compile time, whereas
      this HTML file is entirely static and better represents an external site
      including these scripts. Notably, this file
      <strong>will not work</strong> when running
      <code>npm run dev</code> because the ESBuild output does not give a single
      index.js for consumption by static files! To see this file work, please
      view it by running <code>npm run serve</code>
